driveSquare

This sample shows one option for coding Misty to drive in a square.

We've left a lot of comments in this code for developers new to the
Misty platform. If you already know your way around, feel free to
ignore them!

Note: The squareDrive() function in this sample expects Misty's heading
(yaw value from IMU) to be 0 when it runs. Misty's heading is set to 0
when Misty boots up; however, because this heading updates continuously
as Misty moves around, we can't be sure what the heading will be when
you run this sample. To work around this, the first call on the
misty.DriveArc() method in this sample rotates Misty back to a heading
of 0.

Note: This is not the only way to programmatically drive Misty in a square.
Another option is to use Misty's current absolute heading to calculate
new heading values to pass into calls on the misty.DriveHeading() and
misty.DriveArc() methods.
**********************************************************************/


// Rotates Misty back to an absolute heading of 0 over 4000ms
misty.DriveArc(0, 0.0, 4000, false);
// Pauses skill execution for 4000ms (when rotation is complete)
misty.Pause(4000);

// Starting from a heading of 0, drives Misty in a square with sides
// 0.5 meters long. For each side of the square, Misty drives 0.5
// meters, then turns in a 90 arc before navigating the next side.
// Navigating the full perimeter of this square takes ~24 seconds.

function squareDrive() {
    var i;
    for (i = 0; i < 360; i+=90) {
        // Drives the length of one side of the square
        misty.DriveHeading(i, 0.2, 3000, false);
        // Pauses execution to prevent other commands from overriding
        // the misty.driveHeading() method. Adjust this timing to have
        // Misty drive without stopping
        misty.Pause(3500);
        // Turns Misty in a 90 degree arc before driving the next length
        // of the square.
        misty.DriveArc(i+90, 0.0, 3000, false);
        // Pauses execution to prevent other commands from overriding
        // the misty.driveArc() method. Adjust this timing to have
        // Misty drive without stopping
        misty.Pause(3500);
    };

    // Loop to continue driving in a square. Misty continues driving
    // until the skill is canceled or times out. Remove this line if
    // Misty should only drive in one full square.
    squareDrive();
}

squareDrive();
