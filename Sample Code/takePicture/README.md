# takePicture

This sample shows how to code Misty to take a picture with her RGB camera, save the picture to her local storage, and show it on her display. We also have Misty play a camera shutter sound, so you can hear (as well as see!) when she's taken the picture.

You can run this code on your robot by uploading the files from this folder to Misty via the Skill Runner web tool. Alternately, refer to this code sample (or copy and paste it into your own skills) when working on similar functionality.
