# JavaScript SDK Code Samples

This folder contains code samples that show how to use different features of Misty's JavaScript SDK. You can run many of these samples on your robot without any modification, or you can refer to these samples when coding similar functionality in your own Misty skills. We'll be adding more samples to this collection as we add features to the Misty platform.

*Our goal is to keep these samples up-to-date with Misty's current software. If you have questions or find something that's not working, let us know by [posting in the Community Forums](https://community.mistyrobotics.com/c/support), or create an issue right here in the JavaScript-SDK repository.*
