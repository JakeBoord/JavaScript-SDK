This repository contains the code and meta files required to run Misty's `HelloWorld` skill. You can download these files and install them on your [Misty II](https://www.mistyrobotics.com/) robot to run the skill. Or, you can work through the [Hello World series in the Misty Docs](https://docs.mistyrobotics.com/misty-ii/robot/hello-world/) to code your own `HelloWorld` skill from scratch!
