# Tutorial | Time-of-Flight

This folder includes the full sample from the [tutorial on using Misty's time-of-flight sensors](https://docs.mistyrobotics.com/misty-ii/coding-misty/javascript-sdk-tutorials/#time-of-flight).

To run this code on your robot, compress the `HelloWorld_TimeOfFlight.js` and `HelloWorld_TimeOfFlight.json` files into a `.zip` archive. Then follow [these instructions](https://docs.mistyrobotics.com/tools-&-apps/web-based-tools/skill-runner) to upload and run the code.
