# Misty II JavaScript SDK

This repository provides runnable sample code, tutorials, and sandbox projects to help you create skills with Misty's JavaScript SDK.

For different examples of how to use Misty's .NET SDK and REST API, see the .NET-SDK and REST-API repositories.

## Using this repository

Use the green __Clone or download__ button to create a local version of this repository on your desktop. The repository includes three directories:

* **Sample Code** - Runnable examples that demonstrate how to perform different tasks with Misty's JavaScript SDK. Refer to these samples (or copy and paste the code into your own JavaScript skills) when developing skills that require similar functionality.
* **Tutorials** - Complete, runnable skills from the written tutorials published in the Misty Robotics developer documentation.
* **Sandbox** - A collection of skills and code samples that are not actively maintained by the Misty team. Some of these skills require external hardware or integrations with third-party services. Sandbox code may not be up-to-date with Misty's current software.

You can run the JavaScript code samples from this repository on your own Misty II by uploading the code and meta files to Misty via the [Skill Runner](http://sdk.mistyrobotics.com/skill-runner/) web tool, or by using the [Misty JavaScript](https://docs.mistyrobotics.com/tools-&-apps/plugins-&-extensions/misty-skills-extension/) extension for Visual Studio Code. Refer to these code samples (or copy and paste them into your own skills) when working on similar functionality in your own skill development.

Find something that doesn't work? Help us fix it by creating an issue right here in the JavaScript-SDK repository! Along with a brief description of the issue, let us know what operating system you're using and what version of Misty's software you're working with. If you can, write down the steps to reproduce the issue, and be sure to include any relevant screenshots or error messages. Sharing this information helps us discover the root cause more quickly.
